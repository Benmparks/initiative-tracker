InitiativeTracker
=================

This is an initiative tracker tool for use specifically for Fantasy Craft.  It could easily be adapted to any
tabletop RPG that uses an OGL/D20 style initiative tracking.

This is an older project (last updates made in 2014) and I'm not even sure that this will run on a modern Android device.  However, I feel like it shows experience working in Java and a working understanding and knowledge of SQL databases and schemas.

I'd eventually like to return to this project and update it if time allows.
